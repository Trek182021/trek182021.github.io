            <hr>
            <p>Gnome sort is a sorting algorithm originally proposed by Iranian computer scientist Hamid Sarbazi-Azad (professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Sharif University of Technology) in 2000. The sort was first called stupid sort (not to be confused with bogosort), and then later described by Dick Grune and named gnome sort.</p>
            <p>The gnome sort is similar to insertion sort in a way that it works with one item at a time but gets the item to the proper place by a series of swaps, similar to a bubble sort. It is conceptually simple, requiring no nested loops.</p>

            <p>Gnome Sort also called Stupid sort is based on the concept of a Garden Gnome sorting his flower pots. A garden gnome sorts the flower pots by the following method- </p>
            <ul>
                <li>He looks at the flower pot next to him and the previous one; if they are in the right order he steps one pot forward, otherwise he swaps them and steps one pot backwards.</li>
                <li>If there is no previous pot (he is at the starting of the pot line), he steps forwards; if there is no pot next to him (he is at the end of the pot line), he is done.</li>

                    --> While the position is not equal to the size of array. 
                    while pos < length(a):

                        -->  If the position is in the first spot of the array,
                        -->  If number in spot we're in is greater than the number behind,
                        -->  Move one space
                        if (pos == 0 or a[pos] >= a[pos-1]):
                            pos := pos + 1

                        -->  Otherwise, Swap value in present position and the previous value.
                        else:
                            swap a[pos] and a[pos-1]

            <p>Limitations of Gnome Sort:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Since Gnome Sort is not quite the fastest sorting algorithm, its not used very much, but it could a good starting point in understanding how other sorting algorithm works.</li>
                <li>An example would be, the <a href="#insert-sort">insertion sort</a> which is one of the basic sorting algorithms which works the same way as gnome sort without the going back step whenever a swap takes place.</li>
                <li>The average running time of this algorithm is O(n^2) but tends towards O(n) if the list is nearly sorted.</li>
